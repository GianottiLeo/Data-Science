# Data Science Introducion
Projects developed during my course in USP SCC0275


During the duration of this course, I had the opportunity to learn a lot more about data manipulation and analysis, through the Python programming language. One of the highlights was the introduction to the powerful pandas library, which opened up a world of possibilities for handling data structures. Additionally, I solidified my numerical computing capabilities using NumPy library.

As the course progressed, I we used both pandas and NumPy more and more, tacking a wide array of data-related tasks, transforming data, taking insights by exploratory data analysis, implementing sophisticated machine learning algorithms and many others. By the end of the course, I had not only acquired a strong foundation in pandas and NumPy but also developed the confidence to apply them effectively in real-world scenarios.

The knowledge and skills gained from this experience have undoubtedly enhanced my proficiency as a data analyst, equipping me with invaluable tools to tackle diverse challenges and drive meaningful insights from data.
